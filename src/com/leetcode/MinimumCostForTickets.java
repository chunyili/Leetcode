/**
 * In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.
 * The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
 *
 * Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:
 *
 * a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
 * a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
 * a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
 * The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2,
 * then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation:
 * For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
 * On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
 * On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
 * On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
 * In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
 * Output: 17
 * Explanation:
 * For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
 * On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
 * On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
 * In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= days.length <= 365
 * 1 <= days[i] <= 365
 * days is in strictly increasing order.
 * costs.length == 3
 * 1 <= costs[i] <= 1000
